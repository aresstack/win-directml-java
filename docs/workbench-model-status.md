# Workbench model runtime status (WORKBENCH-MODEL-STATUS-1)

Audit of every generation model family in the Workbench: is it selectable, is it executable, which backend
path runs for WARP / AUTO / CPU, and is any stale `planned` / `probe` / `experimental` /
"Runtime integration is planned" wording or silent Python fallback left over. Gemma is the reference
(WARP/AUTO native, CPU legacy external, no visible research mode).

Audit-only slice: no runtime optimization, no migration. The state below is what the code does today; the
prior Gemma slices (PRODUCT-1/2 + closeout) and the homogeneous-lifecycle work already removed the
user-visible residue, so this slice confirms it and locks it in with `WorkbenchModelStatusAuditTest`.

## Status table

| Model family | Dropdown | WARP | AUTO | CPU | Registry status | Executable | Remark |
|--------------|----------|------|------|-----|-----------------|------------|--------|
| **Gemma 3 270M-it** | yes | native DirectML (WARP software adapter) | native DirectML (first hardware adapter, optional) | legacy external Python | EXPERIMENTAL (internal, not shown) | **yes — product** | Closed out. Download tab = `Gemma3PackageLifecycle` (Convert/READY). No visible research label (runtime label `native-warp`). |
| Gemma 3 270M (base) | yes | native (no product package) | native | legacy external Python | PLANNED | no | Base checkpoint; selecting it without a package → clear Download→Convert message (no silent Python). |
| **Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-it** | yes | native DirectML INT4 (`model_q4f16.wdmlpack`) | native DirectML INT4 | engine backend | EXPERIMENTAL | **yes** | Runnable by status (WORKBENCH-MODEL-STATUS-2) — the PLANNED-guard `qwenTestModel` exemption was removed; `isQwenTestModel` now only routes to `QwenInferenceEngine` (like the other families' routing). No Python. |
| Qwen2.5-Coder 1.5B / 3B | yes | — | — | — | PLANNED | no | "selectable but not executable yet" (honest guard message). |
| **SmolLM2-135M / 360M** | yes | native DirectML/WARP (dense projections on the D3D12 software rasterizer), CPU reference-runtime fallback when no WARP device | hardware GPU when present, else CPU reference runtime | reference runtime | EXPERIMENTAL | **yes — from `.wdmlpack`** | No Python. Missing package → clear "Use Download tab → Convert". Audited honest in SMOLLM2-PRODUCT-AUDIT-1 (see below). |
| **T5 / Flan-T5 / CodeT5** | yes | mixed: dense projections + LM-head on DirectML/WARP, rest on CPU reference (uncertified) | same on hardware adapter | validated Java reference seq2seq | EXPERIMENTAL | **yes — from `.wdmlpack`** | Seq2seq. No Python. `T5InferenceEngine`. CPU=certified path; WARP/AUTO=experimental mixed path. Audited honest in T5-PRODUCT-AUDIT-1 (see below). |
| **Phi-3 mini (onnx)** | yes | `Phi3Summarizer`/`Phi3InferenceEngine` (backend forwarded) | same | same | EXPERIMENTAL | yes (runtime present) | Runs via the Phi-3 engine; the panel notes "no direct ONNX execution / from a wdmlpack". Exact engine internals not re-verified in this Gemma-scoped audit. No Python. |
| Phi-3.5 mini (onnx) | yes | — | — | — | PLANNED | no | "selectable but not executable yet". |

## Findings

- **No user-visible stale wording.** The dropdown lists model ids only (no status tooltip). The only visible
  research term had been the Gemma runtime label `native-warp-experimental` → already fixed to `native-warp`
  (PRODUCT-2) and the Gemma "probe" notes → "legacy external Python" (closeout). No `Runtime integration is
  planned` string exists anywhere in the repo (verified); locked by `WorkbenchModelStatusAuditTest`.
- **Executable models are not blocked.** The Summarizer's PLANNED guard only fires for genuinely
  not-executable PLANNED models (Phi-3.5, Qwen 1.5B/3B, Gemma base); Gemma/SmolLM2/T5/Phi-3 and Qwen 0.5B
  are EXPERIMENTAL (runnable). Qwen 0.5B is runnable by status — the `qwenTestModel` PLANNED-guard exemption
  was removed in WORKBENCH-MODEL-STATUS-2 (the predicate now only routes to `QwenInferenceEngine`). Locked by
  the audit test.
- **Not-executable models are clearly marked**, both in the Summarizer ("selectable but not executable yet.
  Status: planned…") and in the Download tab (`package compiler not implemented (downloadable, not
  executable)` for families without a compiler).
- **Python only where allowed.** The single Python path is the Gemma `Backend = CPU` legacy external
  runner. WARP/AUTO never use Python/Transformers/ONNX-Runtime; no silent Python fallback (a missing Gemma
  package fails with a clear Download→Convert message).
- **Download-tab status is correct for Gemma.** `DefaultModelArtifactService` wires `Gemma3PackageLifecycle`
  (`hasCompiler()=true` → Convert/READY). The old download/probe-only remnants — `Gemma3DownloadLifecycle`,
  `ModelArtifactRow.gemmaDownloadOnlyStatusText`, and the `downloadOnlyCandidate` "Download only" label — were
  **removed in WORKBENCH-MODEL-STATUS-3**. `NOT_SUPPORTED` now uniformly renders "Compiler missing" (package
  compiler not implemented) for any compiler-less family; Gemma is not one of them.

## SmolLM2 audit (SMOLLM2-PRODUCT-AUDIT-1)

SmolLM2 135M/360M are honest, executable Workbench paths — no Runtime-optimization changes, audit/labels only:
- **Selectable + runnable.** Both are `EXPERIMENTAL` → in the dropdown and runnable by status. The redundant
  `!smolLm2Model` PLANNED-guard exemption was removed (`SummarizerPanel`) — SmolLM2 is runnable by status, not
  by a hard-coded exception (consistent with the Qwen 0.5B fix).
- **Routing (honest, no overclaim).** `Backend = WARP` → native DirectML/WARP runtime (dense projections on
  the D3D12 software rasterizer; norms/RoPE/attention/KV stay on CPU), with a transparent CPU
  reference-runtime fallback when the WARP path is not executable (the panel prints `Runtime mode` +
  `Runtime fallback` with the precise reason). `Backend = AUTO` → native on a hardware GPU when present, else
  the reference runtime. `Backend = CPU` → reference runtime. **No Python anywhere.**
- **Missing package** → `SmolLM2WorkbenchRuntimeRunner` fails fast with "Missing SmolLM2 runtime package. Use
  Download tab → Convert" (never compiles, never silently falls back).
- **Stale wording fixed.** The readiness line "…kernel execution is the next WARP implementation step"
  (implying WARP is unimplemented — it is not; `SmolLM2NativeWarpExecutor` is the default) was replaced with
  an honest "WARP path prepared but not executable here; using the CPU reference runtime (<reason>)". The
  legacy `SmolLM2DirectMlWarpExecutor` "probe" ("kernels not implemented yet") is a diagnostic opt-in
  (`-Dsmollm2.warp.executor=probe`), not the product path. Registry notes updated to describe the native
  WARP + reference-fallback path.

## T5 audit (T5-PRODUCT-AUDIT-1)

T5/Flan-T5/CodeT5 are honest, executable Workbench paths — audit/labels only, no T5 runtime change:
- **Selectable + runnable.** All four curated models (`Salesforce/codet5-small`,
  `Salesforce/codet5-base-multi-sum`, `google-t5/t5-small`, `google/flan-t5-small`) are `EXPERIMENTAL` → in
  the dropdown and runnable by status. They are not `PLANNED`, so the Summarizer's PLANNED guard never blocks
  them and no T5 guard exemption exists (unlike the old Qwen/SmolLM2 exemptions there was never one to remove).
- **Routing (honest, no overclaim).** `Backend = CPU` → the **validated** Java reference seq2seq runtime
  (`T5Runtime.load`). `Backend = WARP / AUTO` → a **mixed** path (`T5Runtime.loadWarp` = encoder + decoder +
  LM-head WARP boundaries): the dense projections (attention/feed-forward + LM-head matvecs) run through
  DirectML on the WARP software adapter (WARP) or first hardware adapter (AUTO) via the shared
  `WarpDenseProjection` / `MatMulNBitsKernel`, while layer norms, attention softmax, and relative-position bias
  stay on the CPU reference path. This mixed path **executes but is not yet correctness-certified** — it is
  surfaced as experimental, not as a finished native runtime. The panel prints the precise stage routing as the
  execution mode (e.g. `reference` or `warp-encoder-boundary+warp-decoder-boundary+warp-lm-head`). **No Python
  on any T5 path** (the engine consumes only the `.wdmlpack`; it never runs ONNX/PyTorch/HF through a foreign
  runtime).
- **Missing package** → `T5InferenceEngine` fails fast (lifecycle `validateOrThrowBeforeInference`; the panel's
  `validateT5ModelFiles` adds a clear "Download or compile the selected T5 model first" message). Runtime never
  compiles.
- **Stale wording fixed.** Added an honest panel NOTE that WARP/AUTO is the mixed, uncertified path and CPU is
  the validated one (previously the panel only said "runs from a prebuilt .wdmlpack" and never disclosed the
  mixed routing — a user picking WARP could assume a fully native runtime). Corrected the stale `T5Runtime`
  class javadoc ("API shell for the future T5 WARP runtime" — the WARP boundary pipelines exist) and the
  `UNSUPPORTED_MESSAGE` constant ("…not implemented yet" → "…not certified yet"; it is no longer thrown and is
  retained only as a javadoc anchor for the package-level certification scope). Registry notes already used
  internal "Experimental …" wording with no `planned`/`probe`/`not implemented`/`runtime integration` residue.

## Gemma reference (unchanged)

Gemma stays the reference product path and is untouched by this slice: `Backend = WARP` → native
Java/DirectML on the WARP software adapter (no Python); `Backend = AUTO` → native on the first hardware
adapter (optional, clear message when none); `Backend = CPU` → legacy external Python only. Paris smoke
(" Paris", token 9079) green on WARP and HARDWARE (gated tests). See `gemma3-warp-runtime-plan.md`
(Status: COMPLETE).
